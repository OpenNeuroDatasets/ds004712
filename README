2. T2w FLAIR, 
3. diffusion MRI (dMRI), 
4. resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI), 
5. susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI)


### Experimental location

### Notes
Anatomical data have been defaced following the UKBiobank defacing procedure. Defacing masks are available in each session directory as sub-<subID>_ses-<sesID>_mod-T1w_defacemask.nii.gz.

At time of release, SWI data were not yet incorporated in to the BIDS standard. The SWI extension proposal (https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.1/06-extensions.html: accessed Autumn 2022) was used to define SWI data structure.


Minor deviations of protocols for individual scans
The majority of subjects were acquired using the same protocols. However, for some subjects
there were minor deviations in some protocol parameters that we describe here for
completeness.

Cohort A
- 3T GE MR750 fMRI: For the fMRI scan sub-03286/ses-NOT3GEM, we acquired two versions of the rfMRI data with i) an isotropic spatial resolution of 2.4mm and ii) a spatial resolution of 2.2x2.2x3.4mm. For 6 subjects scanned under the 3T GE MR750 (03286, 03997, 10975, 12813, 14482, 14221) there was a mismatch in PE direction between dMRI and fMRI that needs to be accounted for in the processing pipeline.
- Philips Achieva dMRI: In most cases, the dMRI protocol included 6 b=0 s/mm2 volumes. Four subjects (13305, 13192, 14229, 14230) were acquired with 2 b=0 s/mm2 volumes.
- Philips Ingenia dMRI: In most cases, dMRI data were acquired using an in-plane acceleration factor of 1.5 (TE=98ms, TR=4.4s). For 4 subjects (13305, 13192, 14229, 14230), the dMRI data
were acquired using an in-plane acceleration factor of 2 (TE=92ms, TR=3.9s).


Cohort B
- The fMRI scans sub-15320/ses-NOT2ING006/func/sub-15320_ses-NOT2ING006_task-rest_bold.nii.gz  and sub-16975/ses-NOT1ACH001/func/sub-16975_ses-NOT1ACH001_task-rest_bold.nii.gz are missing a volume, which has been excluded because it was corrupted during the scan.
- The dMRI reversed-phase-encode b=0 sub-16793/ses-OXF4GEP001/dwi/sub-16793_ses-OXF4GEP001_dir-PA_dwi.nii.gz has been wrongly acquired with phase encode direction LR instead of PA.
- No dMRI reversed-phase-encode b=0 sub-16794/ses-OXF4GEP001/dwi/sub-16794_ses-OXF4GEP001_dir-PA_dwi.nii.gz has been acquired and a smoothed one has been synthesised using Synb0-DisCo (Schilling et al., 2019, Magn. Res. Img., doi.org/10.1016/j.mri.2019.05.008) along the same direction as the one acquired. Synb0-DisCo settings should be used to obtain a field map using this data.



Incidental Findings
- A cortical hypointensity visible on the left hemisphere (for fMRI, dMRI and SWI) was observed for Subject 16766, cohort B. The subject is healthy and Incidental finding inspection deemed this as a non-pathological feature. Overall, the z-scored IDPs and QC measures for that subject scans were not considerably different from the mean of all subjects, so we kept the scans in the cohort.
