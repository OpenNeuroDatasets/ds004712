### Apparatus

Scanners:
1. Philips Achieva, 2. Philips Ingenia, 3. GE MR750, 4. Siemens Prisma (32ch), 5. Siemens Prisma (64 ch), 6. Siemens Trio

Modalities:
1. T1w, 2. T2w FLAIR, 3. diffusion MRI (dMRI), 4. resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI), 5. susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI)

### Notes
Anatomical data have been defaced following the UKBB defacing procedure. Defacing masks are available in each session directory as sub-<subID>_ses-<sesID>_mod-T1w_defacemask.nii.gz.

At time of release, SWI data were not yet incorporated in to the BIDS standard. The SWI extension proposal (https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.1/06-extensions.html: accessed Autumn 2022) was used to define SWI data structure.
