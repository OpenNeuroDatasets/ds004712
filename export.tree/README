### Notes
Anatomical data have been defaced following the UKBiobank defacing procedure. Defacing masks are available in each session directory as sub-<subID>_ses-<sesID>_mod-T1w_defacemask.nii.gz.

At time of release, SWI data were not yet incorporated in to the BIDS standard. The SWI extension proposal (https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.1/06-extensions.html: accessed Autumn 2022) was used to define SWI data structure.


Minor deviations of protocols for individual scans
The majority of subjects were acquired using the same protocols. However, for some subjects there were minor deviations in some protocol parameters that we describe here for completeness.

Phase A
- GE MR 750 rfMRI: For one subject (03286), we acquired two versions of the rfMRI data with 1) an isotropic spatial resolution of 2.4mm and 2) a spatial resolution of 2.2x2.2x3.4mm. Neither matched the 3.3mm isotropic data acquired for other subjects.  For 6 subjects (03286, 03997, 10975, 12813, 14482, 14221) there was a mismatch in PE direction between dMRI and fMRI that we accounted for in the processing pipeline.
- Philips Achieva dMRI: In most cases, the dMRI protocol included 6 b=0 s/mm2 volumes. Four subjects (13305, 13192, 14229, 14230) were acquired with 2 b=0 s/mm2 volumes.
- Philips Ingenia dMRI: In most cases, dMRI data were acquired using an in-plane acceleration factor of 1.5 (TE=98ms, TR=4.4s). For 4 subjects (13305, 13192, 14229, 14230), the dMRI data were acquired using an in-plane acceleration factor of 2 (TE=92ms, TR=3.9s).


Phase B
- Philips Achieva fMRI: 16975 (16975_NOT1ACH001) has a single volume missing, due to data corruption during reconstruction.
- Philips Ingenia fMRI: 15320 (15320_NOT2ING006) has a single volume missing, due to data corruption during reconstruction.
- GE Premier 21 (Oxford) dMRI: For session 16793_OXF4GEP001, the dMRI reversed-phase-encode b=0 was incorrectly acquired with a left-right (LR) phase-encode direction instead of posterior-anterior (PA). We accounted for this by running a bespoke fieldmap estimation with FSL's topup (Andersson et al. NeuroImage 2003), which was fed into the UKBB pipeline for further processing. For session 16745_OXF4GEP001, dMRI were acquired with a slice thickness of 2.4 mm, instead of 2.0 mm.
- GE Premier 21 (Oxford) anatomical: For subjects 15320, 16793, 16794, 16974, 16766, 16745, the T2w FLAIR was acquired with a 1.3x1x1 mm resolution instead of 1x1x1 mm. For sessions 16793 and 16794, the T1w MPRAGE was acquired with a 212x256x256 matrix size, instead with 256x256x212.
- GE Premier 42 (Nottingham) dMRI: For session 16794_NOT4GEP001, no dMRI reversed-phase-encode b=0 image was acquired. In this case, we generated a synthetic distortion-free b=0 image using Synb0-DisCo (v3.0) (Schilling et al. Magn Reson Imaging. 2019, Schilling et al. PLoS ONE 2020) with the same phase-encoding (anterior-posterior, AP) direction as the main data. A fieldmap was then estimated from the synthetic distortion-free b=0 and acquired b=0 data using FSL's topup, which was then used for further processing.



Incidental Findings
- A cortical hypointensity visible on the right hemisphere (for fMRI, dMRI and SWI) was observed for Subject 16766, phase B. The subject is healthy and Incidental finding inspection deemed this as a non-pathological feature. Overall, the z-scored IDPs and QC measures for that subject scans were not considerably different from the mean of all subjects, so we kept these scans.
